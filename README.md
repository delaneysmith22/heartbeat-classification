# heartbeat-classification
This code was written in collaboration with a classmate for a group project in a statistical learning - classification course. Using it, we reproduce and extend the results of Romdhane et al. (2020) and classify electrocardiogram heart beats using a deep convolutional neural network with focal loss.
